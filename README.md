### Continued development

This small project was a challenge on based on time to completion. I estimated about 5 hours until completion, starting at roughly 6pm initializing the project, nearly completing it by 11:00pm PST. I also aimed to try it using CSS only (no frameworks) to see if i've improved my confidence in writing CSS (or SCSS in this case). It is a close however there are small differences with the design spec.
